caption:
    (Rudman, 1982)<br/>
    **Baeolidia australis** is distinguished from **Baeolidia moebii** by having a thin orange sub-apical band above a broad blue band on each ceras, which is never present in **Baeolidia moebii**. **Baeolidia australis** looks bluish whereas **Baeolidia moebii** is more yellow or brown. The body of **Baeolidia australis** also seems to have a brown and white reticulate pattern that is not found in **Baeolidia moebii**.
